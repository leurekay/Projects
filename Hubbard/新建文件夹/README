#hVMC

hVMC is a free Variational Monte Carlo code for the Hubbard model.

I wrote hVMC as a part of my master's thesis in physics. It is written in C++11
and I have tried to keep the amount of code not immediately related to the
actual calculation (e.g. IO, communication, command line parsing) to a minimum.
To this purpose hVMC makes heavy use of template libraries like the STL, Boost
and Eigen3. I spent a lot of time profiling and optimizing hVMC to make sure it
runs as fast as possible. A particularly nice feature is that hVMC performs some
(the most expensive) calculations in single precision and keeps track of
resulting floating point errors at runtime in order to ensure the validity of
the results. hVMC is parallelized using MPI and should run efficiently on any
distributed memory machine, even one where not all processors are equally fast.
For large enough calculations I have seen practically linear scaling up to
hundreds of processors.

The documentation of hVMC is a bit lacking as I had very little time between the
submission of my master's thesis and the start of my PhD studies. The closest
thing to a hVMC documentation is actually my master's thesis itself, which not
only includes all the theoretical background and a discription of the hVMC
internals, but also has an appendix that descibes how to build and use hVMC.
My thesis is part of the hVMC repository and can be found in docs/thesis.pdf.

I hope that hVMC is useful! Feel free to contact me with any questions or bugs
that come up!
